     <ul>
        <li>Core Java
            <p>This course covers the theoretical foundations of Java, including its history, 
            key features, and object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, 
            polymorphism, and abstraction. You will also learn about platform independence, 
            JVM, memory management, data types, operators, exception handling, and multithreading, 
            building a strong base for practical Java programming.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Programming 
            <p>This Java programming course enhances problem-solving and logical thinking skills 
                through 500+ coding challenges. You'll develop the ability to tackle complex 
                problems and refine your critical thinking, laying a strong foundation for
